Simple extension I built to customize the start screen of my Chrome browser. Depending on when you see this, it could look a bit different from the last time in terms of design and features (depends on how I am feeling), but It will also always be a great template to build your own Chrome Extension.

## How to Install

1. **Clone / Download this repo**: Start by downloading this repo or cloning it on to your local machine by running ```git clone git@github.com:ogurinkaben/chrome-desktop.git```

2. **Extract the Files**: Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded .zip file and extract its contents to a folder on your computer. You can usually do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Extract" or by using a file extraction tool. If you cloned the repo, then you can skip the extraction step.

3. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**: Open Google Chrome and type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar, then press Enter. This will take you to the Extensions page.

4. **Enable Developer Mode**: In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, toggle on the "Developer mode" option. This enables advanced features for managing extensions.

5. **Load Unpacked Extension**: After enabling Developer mode, you'll see additional options appear. Click on the "Load unpacked" button.

6. **Select Extension Folder**: A file dialog box will appear. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files in step 2, and then select the folder.

7. **Confirm Installation**: Once you've selected the extension folder, click the "Open" button. Chrome will now load the extension from the folder you selected.

8. **Extension Installed**: Congratulations! The extension should now be installed locally on your Chrome browser. You should see its icon appear in the Chrome toolbar, and you can start using it.
